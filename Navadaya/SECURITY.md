## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** Create a Public Issue
Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

### 2. Report Privately
Send details to: **security@navadaya-hostel.com** (or create a private issue)

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Based on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 1-30 days
  - Medium: 30-90 days
  - Low: Next major release

## Security Measures

### Application Security

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Firebase Authentication with secure token management
- Role-based access control (Admin/Student)
- Session timeout and automatic logout
- Password strength requirements
- Google OAuth integration

#### Data Protection
- HTTPS-only communication in production
- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS protection through proper escaping
- CSRF protection for forms
- Secure headers implementation

#### Firebase Security
- Firestore security rules restricting data access
- API key restrictions to authorized domains
- Real-time audit logging
- Regular security rule reviews

### Receipt Security System

#### Advanced Verification
- **Multi-parameter verification codes** using:
  - Fee ID
  - Student roll number
  - Amount
  - Timestamp
- **Cryptographic security hashes** for tamper detection
- **QR code verification** with embedded security data

#### Anti-Forgery Features
- Complex hash algorithms for receipt validation
- Timestamp-based verification
- Domain-specific security tokens
- Digital signature verification

### Infrastructure Security

#### Deployment Security
- Environment variable protection
- Secure session secret generation
- Production configuration hardening
- Regular dependency updates

#### Data Storage
- Firebase Firestore with enterprise-grade security
- Encrypted data transmission
- Regular automated backups
- Access logging and monitoring

## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **Use Strong Passwords**
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
   - Use password manager

2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Use Google Authenticator or similar
   - Backup recovery codes securely

3. **Regular Security Reviews**
   - Monitor access logs
   - Review user permissions quarterly
   - Update security rules as needed

4. **Secure Environment**
   - Keep admin devices updated
   - Use secure networks
   - Log out after sessions

### For Developers
1. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Use dependency scanning tools
   - Remove unused dependencies

3. **Configuration**
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use environment variables
   - Implement proper logging
   - Set up monitoring alerts

## Common Security Considerations

### Database Security
```javascript
// Firestore Security Rules Example
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Students can only access their own data
    match /students/{studentId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == studentId;
    }
    
    // Admin-only collections
    match /admin/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.token.admin == true;
    }
  }
}
```

### Session Management
- Sessions expire after 24 hours of inactivity
- Automatic logout on browser close
- Secure session token storage
- Regular session cleanup

### API Security
- Rate limiting implementation
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Proper error messages (no sensitive data exposure)
- Authentication required for all operations

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Breach
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Document the incident
   - Preserve evidence
   - Assess the scope

2. **Containment**
   - Disable affected accounts
   - Revoke compromised tokens
   - Apply temporary fixes

3. **Recovery**
   - Implement permanent fixes
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Update security measures

4. **Communication**
   - Notify affected users
   - Provide incident report
   - Implement lessons learned
